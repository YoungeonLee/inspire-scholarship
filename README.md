# Inspire Scholarship - Youngeon Lee

## Other than another person, what inspires you to be a better person? 

I am inspired daily to be a better person by the thought of everyone working together to create a better world.
As an engineering student, I selected programming as a mode of communication that best fits my personality.
To express this idea through programming, I created a simulation where people collaborate to create the University of Utah's logo.
Characters have the option of working, healing, or resting.
Characters with a higher level of kindness have a higher possibility of working on the project or healing those around them
whereas those with a low kindness stat will be more likely to rest.
Working will cost a character one of their ten initial health points and require them to be healed by a neighbor
before losing all ten health points. Resting has no negative or positive consequences.
Explore the website by clicking on “Start All”, and you will see the difference between kind and unkind.
